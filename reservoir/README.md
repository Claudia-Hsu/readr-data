All of the data is from http://fhy.wra.gov.tw/ReservoirPage_2011/StorageCapacity.aspx and we crawl the data by the code in https://github.com/tasi788/TaiwanReservoir.

Due the the schedule, we didn't fine tune the date. So you see the date including the 2/30 or 2/31, that is a known issue. Please feel free to fix it and send the pull request.
